# Technical Database Analysis of Employee Retirment Data using Postgres SQL

## Technical Database Analysis of Employee Retirement Data Overview
This project is to perform technical database analysis to:
1. Help determine the number of retiring employees per title
2. Determine of this retiring employees who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program

### Technical Database Analysis of Employee Retirement Data Background
* Six csv files were provided and examined: employees.csv, departments.csv. dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
* PostgresSQL was downloaded and installed
* Looking at the .csv files target database keys were identified (primary keys and foreign keys) and entity relationships were determined
* An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created using Quick DBD
* A PH-EmplyeeDB database was created in pgAdmin
* Tables for the data were created in the pgAdmin database and keys were set using Postgres SQL
* Data was imported into the tables from the .csv files.
* Queries were run looking ate retirement eligiblity and some analysis summary data tables were created and also exported to .csv files
